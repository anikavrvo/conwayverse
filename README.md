# ConwayVerse 🧬

> A configurable, dimensional twist on Conway’s Game of Life.

**ConwayVerse** will be a customizable cellular automaton simulator where users can define:
- 🔢 Number of dimensions (2D or 3D)
- 🌐 Size of a cell’s “bubble” (neighborhood radius)
- 🎨 Custom cell states (more than just alive/dead)
- ⚙️ Flexible update rules based on neighborhood patterns
- 🎮 An interactive grid to design the initial world and simulate its evolution

---

## ✨ Features

- 2D and 3D grid support (coming soon)
- Rule-based engine for multi-state evolution
- Configurable bubble size (neighborhood radius)
- Click-to-edit initial grid state
- One-step or continuous simulation modes
- Minimal UI with fast, reactive controls (React + TypeScript)
